I LOVE coding. Maybe a little too much. Sometimes, when I'm bored, I create random little scripts. Most of these serve little practical purpose. However, I decided to publish them as a reference for people.

## Basics
A lot of the code is **MESSY**

Much of it is not **OPTIMIZED**

This shows how different code can be, for accomplishing the same thing.

Little-None of this code will ever be updated/maintained.

Some of it probably doesn't work


## Enjoy!
I dont check github often. I'm on discord @NotchArrow
